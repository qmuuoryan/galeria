# | By Ryan Muuo |

* This is a personal gallery application that displays photos from different categories and locations for others to see.


# User Stories

* View different photos. Click on a single photo to expand it and also view the details of the photo. The photo    details must appear on a modal within the same route as the main page. Search for different categories of photos. Copy a link to the photo to share with my friends. View photos based on the location they were taken.
